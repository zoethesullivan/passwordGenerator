## Project objectives

- Build project from scratch using loops and arrays
- Generate two unique passwords when user clicks "Generate Passwords" button 
- Password > 15ch

## What I learned

This was a great project to build from scratch. Creating a loop with randomized input from an array was a great stretch goal for me. 

I started with CSS as it's the easier language for me. Not having my Javascript properly built out before my CSS created duplicate work for me.  Below is how I would structure a project like this in the future.

### In the future I would organize my project like

1. Build basic structure in HTML
2. Javascript
	1. Define password characters in `const characters`
	2. Connect JavaScript variables to HTML elements
	3. Listen for button click
	4. Build out the following for **function `generatePassword`**
		1. Create for loop
		2. Randomize characters within loop
		3. Return password
	5. Create unique second password
3. CSS
	1. Add root variables
		1.  ::colors
		2. ::font-family
	2. Match CSS Styling to provided demo
4. Activate GH Pages
5. Review project and update readme.md
6. Add project to portfolio
