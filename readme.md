## Description

This is a learning repository where I can test and use new technologies before moiving onto a new project.

### For V2

- [ ] Install tailwindCSS
  - [ ] Add tailwind elements to project
  - [ ] relaunch

## To-do

- Center application in viewport
- Create buttons and styling for generated passwords

## What I learned

Tailwind is a great tool. Most of the colors I used in my passwordGenerator project were able to be ported over with no issue. The one color I was unable to replicate did not create any problems as I had thought it would. Tailwind allows you to add in arbritrary background colors with '<bg-[#1f2937]'
